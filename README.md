# Multi-Face Recognition with Gaze Tracking for Employee Attendance System

## 🎯 Overview
A face recognition-based attendance system with anti-spoofing technology using gaze tracking and liveness detection. This system leverages deep learning with a VGG16 architecture and includes eye movement verification to prevent spoofing with fake images or videos.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Face Recognition
- Face recognition using a pre-trained VGG16 model
- Supports multiple registered faces in the database
- High accuracy with a 70% confidence threshold

### 2. Anti-Spoofing with Gaze Tracking
- Liveness detection using pupil tracking to prevent spoofing
- Eye movement verification: left, right, center, blink
- Dual mode: gaze-tracking library + OpenCV fallback

### 3. Integrated Attendance System
- IN/OUT attendance logging
- Automatic timestamp recording
- User-friendly interface with PyQt5

### 4. Training System
- Transfer learning with VGG16
- Anti-overfitting measures
- Real-time training progress monitoring

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Face Registration Module (`registrasi_window.py`)
Live Camera Feed → Haar Cascade Face Detection → Capture 500 images/person → Dataset split (70% train, 20% valid, 10% test) → Save to `split/train`, `split/valid`, `split/test`

### 2. Training Module (`training_window.py`)
Load dataset → VGG16 pre-trained model → Transfer learning (Phase 1: freeze base, add classifier) → Fine-tuning (Phase 2: unfreeze top layers, lower LR) → Save model (`model_final.keras`)

### 3. Anti-Spoofing Verification (`spoof.py`)
Camera Input → Face Recognition (load model, confidence > 70%) → Gaze Tracking (random commands: LEFT/RIGHT/CENTER/BLINK) → Multi-stage validation (≥5 frames) → Liveness Confirmed → Access Granted

### 4. Attendance System (`presensi_window.py`)
Verified input → Real-time recognition → Attendance type (IN/OUT) → Timestamp → CSV export (`presensi/data_presensi.csv`)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Deep Learning
- TensorFlow / Keras
- VGG16 backbone with transfer learning
- Regularization, dropout, early stopping

### Computer Vision
- OpenCV for image processing
- `face_recognition` for detection & encoding
- Haar Cascade for real-time detection

### Gaze Tracking
- `gaze-tracking` library (primary)
- OpenCV fallback mode

### GUI
- PyQt5 for desktop app
- Matplotlib for training visualization

## 🚀 System Workflow

**Phase 1: Setup & Registration**
- Input name, capture 500 face images at various angles
- Automatic dataset split into train/valid/test

**Phase 2: Model Training**
- Load VGG16 pre-trained weights
- Transfer learning + anti-overfitting
- Fine-tune for optimal accuracy

**Phase 3: Anti-Spoofing Verification**
- Detect face, check stability (≥10 frames)
- Confirm identity (≥5 consistent frames)
- Random gaze commands with 8s timeout
- Verify action with gaze-tracking / OpenCV fallback

**Phase 4: Access Control & Attendance**
- If all verifications pass → Open attendance module
- Select IN/OUT → Confirm → Save to CSV with timestamp
